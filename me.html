		As an Andina-identifying woman from New York City, raised by a working-class immigrant family, I entered this work with the aim of building towards more full and authentic diasporic identities within the US Latinx framework. During this year’s Forum, as I shared for the first time amongst my new colleagues some of my work and findings as an oral historian; I asked, “How might traditional (ie. colonial, euro-centric) oral history + archival frameworks, such as documenting for purely evidence’s sake, undermine liberatory processes?”</p>
